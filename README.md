## NASA-App 🌑
This is a simple application that uses [NASA's Open API] (https://api.nasa.gov/)

### About the App 🌏 🚀 👩🏽‍🚀
I always had this fascination with the planets (and it is fair to say being an astronaut and owning a telescope is quite THE DREAM for most kids) - I only have a telescope, so this is the next best thing I can do :) 

**Frontend** | **Backend** | **Other Methodologies**
------------ | ------------- | -----------
HTML5 | Node.js | TDD
CSS3 + Sass | Express |Github
React.js |

It is responsive and has accessibility in mind.

### How to get started 💥

At it's very basic, it displays NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD). More features are in the pipeline for this, including:
* having light and dark mode
* being able to view other APOD's from previous dates

### How to replicate NASA-App in your machine 🌑
* Pre-requisites: npm, node, Github || optional: telescope
* Open Terminal, clone Git repository: ```git clone git@github.com:joannebasa/nasa-app.git ```
* Go into the folder: ```cd nasa-app```
* Install node dependencies ```npm i```
* We have lift-off! ```npm start```

### Further Plans 🪐
This app is a work in progress. And future plans with this application include:
* more API integrations
* a React Native app version
* the ability to save favourite APODs, integrate localisation, etc.
